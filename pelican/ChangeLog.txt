2013-01-09  PELICAN 0.9.0

    * First versioned release! (Note pelican should still be considered in
      beta until version 1.0.0)
    * Complete rework of the modular build system.
    * Updated header include paths thoughout pelican, removing the pelican
      prefix. Projects using FindPelican.cmake will need to update to the
      new version of this script.
    * Rework of the CopyFiles macro for added flexibility.
    * Added an addition example code 'example-1' using pelican with 
      service data.
    * Updated Doxygen documentation parameter files for Doxygen 1.8.x.
    * Moved object registation macros out of pelican namespace in order
      to make code using PELICAN slightly cleaner. This change will not effect
      codes already using PELICAN but allow more friendly namespace usage
      in future. Macros affected:
         PELICAN_DECLARE_ADAPTER
         PELICAN_DECLARE_CLIENT
         PELICAN_DECLARE_MODULE
         PELICAN_DECLARE_DATABLOB
         PELICAN_DECLARE_CHUNKER
