@section Overview

You will need to send your processed data elsewhere, perhaps to a storage
system, a monitoring and control system or a further processing pipeline.
Pelican allows you to separate the details of the destination of the data
from the specification of what to write out using the OutputStreamer framework.

You can insert an @em OutputStreamer anywhere in a pipeline and specify the
appropriate data sets.
